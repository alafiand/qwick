# TIC TAC TOE

My first experience with Haskell was facilitated by several resources, listed below. The resources available for learning Haskell are fewer and farther between than those available for popular OOP languages. The answers I sought were found scattered across numerous sites, often from selfless bloggers who documented their own struggles and triumphs with the language.

As promised, making the shift to functional programming was jarring and had a learning curve. I started out by watching several generic "Welcome to Haskell" tutorials to get my bearings and set up my developer environment.

#### Resources

* [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) - Likely the most well-known reference, this book held my hand for learning the fundamentals, and served as a reference when I got to more complex steps in the app
* [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/haskell/) - Another great reference site with helpful examples, though less friendly navigation
* [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) - The community's cheat sheet was very helpful throughout
* [Tsoding Daily](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily) - A youtube channel which offered several walkthroughs using Haskell
* [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) - Several Haskell tutorials, including those by Theofanis Despoudis, Steadylearner, and Nikhil Thomas
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Needs no introduction, I was surprised at how helpful most of the responses were, compared with responses for JavaScript questions
